This project takes a steel data set & has a prediction task involving a power plant. 

The steel loads are 'light_load', 'medium_load' and 'heavy_load' & this data uses logistic regression to train models that are supposed to optimize the power plants energy consumption by predicting which load type is being handled every 15 minutes.
